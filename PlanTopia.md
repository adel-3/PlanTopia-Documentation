# 🌱 PlanTopia – Project Overview & Highlights

## 📌 Project Summary

**PlanTopia** is an intelligent nursery management system that combines modern software architecture with machine learning to solve key problems in plant nurseries.  
It provides a centralized platform for customers, administrators, and workers to manage plant-related tasks, orders, and plant health — all in one place.

The system was developed as part of our graduation project and showcases full integration between backend services, machine learning, and a mobile frontend.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional nursery management relies heavily on manual processes. This causes:

- Errors in stock and order tracking  
- Disorganized task assignment and delays for workers  
- Difficulty for customers to access accurate product information  
- Inaccurate or delayed detection of plant diseases

These issues lead to inefficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, and potential plant loss.
